# Introduction of Parallel Computers

### Architectures

![](..\img\whatispara.png)

##### Shared Memory :

- **SMP**: shared memory multiprocessor, connect multiple processors to a single memory system
- **Multicore**: contains multiple processors on a same chip

##### HPC:

- **Distributed Memory Multiprocessor**: processors with their own memories are connected by a high speed network
- **HPC**: Contains 100s or 1000s of such processors (nodes)

##### SIMD:

- Multiple processors perform same operation on multiple data elements at once (e.g GPU)
